With a commitment to enhancing the efficiency and performance of rail transport, Maven National Rail collaborates with various operators to deliver top-notch solutions that cater to the evolving needs of the railway industry.

## Project Objective
For the Maven Rail Challenge, I took on the role of a Business Intelligence (BI) Developer for National Rail.

My manager tasked me with creating an exploratory dashboard with the following objectives:

 * 1. **Identify the Most Popular Routes:** Analyze booking data to determine which train routes are the most frequented by passengers.

 * 2. **Determine Peak Travel Times:** Assess travel patterns to pinpoint the busiest travel times, allowing for better resource allocation and scheduling.

 * 3. **Analyze Revenue from Different Ticket Types & Classes:** Evaluate revenue streams from various ticket categories and classes to understand financial performance and customer preferences.

 * 4. **Diagnose On-time Performance and Contributing Factors:** Investigate punctuality issues and identify factors that impact train schedules to improve overall service reliability.

Before proceeding further, I would like to provide an overview of the dataset used in this project
